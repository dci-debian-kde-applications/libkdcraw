Comment:
 No license is required to download and use dcraw.c.  However,
 to lawfully redistribute dcraw, you must either (a) offer, at
 no extra charge, full source code* for all executable files
 containing RESTRICTED functions, (b) distribute this code under
 the GPL Version 2 or later, (c) remove all RESTRICTED functions,
 re-implement them, or copy them from an earlier, unrestricted
 Revision of dcraw.c, or (d) purchase a license from the author.
 .
 The functions that process Foveon images have been RESTRICTED
 since Revision 1.237.  All other code remains free for all uses.
 .
 *If you have not modified dcraw.c in any way, a link to my
 homepage qualifies as "full source code".
